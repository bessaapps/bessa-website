        <Heading mb={4}>The Issues LGBTQ People Face on Social</Heading>
        <Text mb={4}>
          Mainstream social media platforms are&apos;t built with LGBTQ people
          in mind and the cracks show. From the start, these spaces have
          prioritized scale, ad revenue, and mass appeal over meaningful
          inclusion. For queer users, that often means navigating environments
          where harassment is common, content moderation is inconsistent, and
          community guidelines seem to shift without warning. Even
          well-intentioned platforms frequently miss the mark, failing to
          understand the specific needs and voices within LGBTQ communities. As
          a result, many queer users find themselves tiptoeing around language,
          reporting abuse that goes unanswered, or even watching their content
          disappear through shadowbanning and censorship.
        </Text>
        <Text mb={4}>
          These issues go deeper than just bugs or bad policy; they reflect a
          lack of representation and investment at every level. Queer creators
          struggle to gain traction in algorithms that suppress
          &quot;non-mainstream&quot; content, while LGBTQ stories are too often
          filtered, flagged, or hidden under vague standards. Platforms profit
          from Pride campaigns one month, then go silent the next. For LGBTQ
          people and the people who love and support them, this creates a
          dissonant, exhausting digital experience&mdash;one that feels more
          disapproving than protective and more interested in monetizing
          identity than honoring it.

        <Text mb={4}>
          I&apos;m Topher ‚Äî a queer bisexual man, software engineer, and the
          creator of Bessa. I built Bessa myself: every line of code, every
          design decision, every intention behind it reflects my hope to help
          LGBTQ people connect, grow, and thrive. The idea started years ago
          while living in Oakland, CA, where I experienced many kinds of
          communities&mdash;some wide open, some closely guarded. I became
          fascinated by the balance between the two, and how the best spaces
          create room for people to show up fully as themselves. Bessa is my
          attempt to bring that idea online to create a vibrant and inclusive
          LGBTQ community that respects culture, values connection, and welcomes
          a broad spectrum of people.
        </Text>
        <Text mb={4}>
          Bessa isn&apos;t backed by a big company or investor. It&apos;s a
          personal project, maintained outside my full-time work as a software
          engineer, and sustained by those who believe in it. If you&apos;re
          LGBTQ, or someone who loves and supports us, I invite you to donate or
          become a sponsor. You&apos;ll be helping keep a living, growing
          platform alive&mdash;one that celebrates diverse genders, ethnicities,
          ages, abilities, and bodies without compromising what makes LGBTQ
          community so powerful. Together, we can build something that truly
          reflects us.
